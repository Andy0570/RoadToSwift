# RealmGitHubSearchRxDemo
The demo app for RxRealm's post on realm.io: <https://academy.realm.io/posts/marin-todorov-realm-rxswift/>

All the fits in a single view controller class to showcase the use of realm + rx for demonstration purposes. You should probably use a proper architecture in your own apps.

## Demo app

To run the demo app install the dependancies via CocoaPods by running `pod install` in the app directory or via your preferred dependency management method.
